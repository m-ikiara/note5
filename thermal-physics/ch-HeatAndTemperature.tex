\chapter{Heat and Temperature}
    \section{What is Heat?}
    We could think of heat as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The transfer of thermal energy from a region of high thermal
        energy to a region of low thermal energy, provided that the two regions
        are in contact, is known as \textbf{heat}.
        \item The transfer of thermal energy between molecules within a system
    \end{itemize}
    The SI unit for Heat is the joule \unit{J}

                      colframe=yellow!70!black,
                      title={Just a heads up...}]
        A body can only lose or gain heat but not possess heat as heat is a
        measure of thermal energy and not a property of matter.
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \section{What is Temperature?}
    We can define temperature as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item (\textbf{\textit{layman}}) the hotness or coldness of a body.
        \item (\textbf{\textit{more technical}}) a measure of the
        \underline{mean} kinetic energy of a body in a thermal energy system.
    \end{itemize}
    The SI unit for Temperature is the kelvin \unit{K}.

    \section{The Zeroth Law}    
    \textbf{Thermodynamics} is the branch of Physics that describes the
    co-relation of properties of macroscopic systems of matter and energy - in
    layman's terms, "\textit{Interaction of Thermal energy with Matter}".

    It is described by 3 fundamental Laws, the first of which is the
    \textbf{Zeroth Law}.

    No heat is transferred between bodies in Thermal equilibrium and thus they
    are of the same Temperature. \cite{halliday2013fundamentals}
    \end{tcolorbox}
    
    If 2 systems \unit{A} \& \unit{B}, are in thermal equilibrium with a third
    system \unit{C}, then they all are in equilibrium with each other.

    \begin{equation}
        A${\cap}$B${\equiv}$C
        \label{eq:the_zeroth_law}
    \end{equation}
